# Vite React Tailwind Template

This is a starter template for creating React apps with Vite, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

Also includes some libs that I use in most of my projects, like:

- tailwind-styled-components (for using Tailwind classes in Styled Components)
- zustand (for state management)
